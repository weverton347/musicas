Whatsoever I've feared has
Come to life
Whatsoever I've fought off
Became my life

Just when everyday
Seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded
And now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time

'Cause I fell on
Black days
I fell on
Black days

Whomsoever I've cured
I've sickened now
Whomsoever I've cradled
I've put you down

I'm a searchlight soul they say
But I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking
When I get it right
When I get it right

'Cause I fell on
Black days
I fell on
Black days

How would I know?
That this could be my fate
How would I know?
That this could be my fate

So what you wanted to see good
Has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours
Has made it mine

So don't you lock up something
That you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking
No, not tying
No, not tying

I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind, sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change

'Cause I fell on
Black days
I fell on
Black days

How would I know?
That this could be my fate
How would I know?
That this could be my fate
How would I know?
That this could be my fate
How would I know?
That this could be my fate

Sure don't mind a change
