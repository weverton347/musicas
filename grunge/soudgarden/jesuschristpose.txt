And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me
You don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me like I

Like I need to be saved
Saved
Like I need to be saved
Saved

In your Jesus Christ pose
In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
And I swear to you
That I would never feed you pain
But your staring at me like I

Like I'm driving the nails
Nails
Like I'm driving the nails
Nails
Like I'm driving the nails
Nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails
Nails

In your Jesus Christ pose
In your Jesus Christ pose

And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out like it's
The coming of the Lord
Would it pay you more to walk on water
Then to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich

Than to bury you
Poor (In your Jesus Christ pose)
Poor (In your Jesus Christ pose)
Poor (In your Jesus Christ pose)
